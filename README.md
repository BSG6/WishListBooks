# WishListBooks

Book Wishlist
A simple app to keep track of books you want to read. Add new books, delete ones you‚Äôve read (or changed your mind about), and keep your reading goals organized‚Äîall in one spot.

How It's Made:
Tech Used:
HTML

JavaScript

Node.js

Express

MongoDB

I built this app as a way to practice full CRUD functionality. Users can add books to a wishlist, view the full list, and remove books when they're done. The backend is powered by Express and MongoDB, and the data is rendered using EJS.

Optimizations (optional):
No styling yet! Future updates will include CSS for layout and mobile responsiveness. I also plan to add sort/filter options, or even status tags like ‚Äúreading,‚Äù ‚Äúread,‚Äù and ‚Äúwant to read.‚Äù

Lessons Learned:
This was a great refresher on how all the parts of a CRUD app come together. I got more comfortable with Express routes, MongoDB queries, and keeping things clean and functional before worrying about design.
